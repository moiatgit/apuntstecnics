This repo contains documentation used for classes some years ago

I don't plan to update these contents in any way, including fixing bugs or broken links, restoring missing files, etc.

The contents are still here just because some teachers reported me they find them useful for their classes.
I don't have any plans to remove this repo and it should be reasonably safe to link to it as long as GitHub accepts hosting it.
